        <h1>E Bhawani Eswar Reddy</h1>
        <p>I am a third year engineering student pursuing BTech in Electronics and Communication Engineering(EXTC) from K.J.Somaiya College of Engineering,Vidyavihar,Mumbai. I had interest in computer based applications since my childhood. The academic curriculum of my college brought me closer to the world of programming. I was introduced to many programming languages such as C , Java, MATLAB, Python as well as Assembly Language. The latest technological advancements in the field of Data Analytics and Machine Learning fascinated me. I have completed NPTEL course on Machine Learning for Engineering and Science Applications conducted by IIT Madras. The course got me acquainted with various machine learning techniques and algorithms. Several applications from the time of introduction of Machine Learning were discussed. ML based chess game, driverless car , heart disease detection were among the several applications discussed.I got fascinated with the power of Machine Learning. As actions speak louder than words,I have uploaded my work samples on Google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bbC-2rvW2JidKbcHh1YIWlzfI6XpBAHV. I am well versed with various programming languages such as Java, Python, C and R studio. I regularly read articles based on advancements in ML. My past experiences would be immensely useful for the internship. I am seeking immensely fruitful learning experience from this internship.
